This project was started in the look for a high performance custom javascript code that could do the same as yolo widthout having to import a 100gb code from tensorflow or whatever you are using.

For you to do a project you should be able to have something light, slick and with high performance, thats it.

I dont want to learn synthax because i dont have patience to do that.

Doing it from scratch allows me to do what i want the exact way i want it.

why is this called Seagull ? 

the first google search reuslts for "images" had a paradise pic, a mountain and you guessed it, a seagull.

so .. what is best for training.

besides that you have this video.
