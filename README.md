# yolojs also knowned as Seagull.js

This project was started in the look for a high performance custom javascript code that could do the same as yolo widthout having to import a 100gb code from tensorflow or whatever you are using.

The project is very simple and uses something called mathematics.

Mathematics is used by human biengs since we learned what simbols are, and in my opinion is best and most useful opensource library that exists.

For you to do a project you should be able to have something light, slick and with high performance, thats it.

I dont want to learn synthax because i dont have patience to do that.

Doing it from scratch allows me to do what i want the exact way i want it.

why is this called Seagull ? 

the first google search reuslts for "images" had a paradise pic, a mountain and you guessed it, a seagull.

so .. what is best for training.

besides that you have this video, that i think describes this project pretty well.
