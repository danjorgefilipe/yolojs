// welcome to something.js, where we do something to make something happen

// first things fisrt, get the image from somewhere

// version 1 for testing, get the image from a file in the repo


// version 2 for webcam, get the userMedia or whatever it is called


// get the pixel matrix from the image and separate it in 3 diffrent layers,
// from there get a soemhting x somehting x 3 matrix ready to get into the neural net flow.

// do convolutions till you get a 7 x 7 x 1024 matrix, the same as
// darknet c++ architecture but more shitty looking, you know, js is not the best looking 
// coding language out there. You know the ugly girl in the party that nobody talks to, unless
// you are truly desperate, thats js.

// get it into a normal deep net, 4096 neurons, keep going

// end up with a 7 x 7 x 30
// this 7 x 7 x 30 has the | (x, y, w , h, obj score) and class probality |

// save the numbers, thats what you need, wheights, bias ect 

// foward ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// get the image





// backward ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
